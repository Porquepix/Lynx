This project is still in development. MANY PARTS WILL CHANGE IN THE NEXT WEEKS. 

Engine to build textual games with json files.  
This project is a personal project but feel free to fork it to play or to improve it. 

# How it works ? 

The core will load each games which meet those requirements: 
- the game is in a sub-folder of 'games' directory 
- this sub-folder contains a file named 'base.json' which describes the game 

To know what properties contain the 'base.json' file, look at the Demo Game.
